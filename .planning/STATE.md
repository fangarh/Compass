# State

## Current Phase

Phase 10: Local IFF Roster completed.

## Last Verified Baseline

2026-05-19:

- Git worktree was clean before planning.
- GSD agents were installed and checked by the user.
- Physical phone `R3CT20C8A8N` was visible through ADB as Samsung SM-S908B.
- Emulator `emulator-5554` was also visible.
- `.planning/` existed but lacked full GSD files.

## Decisions

- Use `stalker/Компас - индекс.md` as the project context entry point.
- Use Wi-Fi for the current radio-detection line.
- Do not use the emulator for real Wi-Fi radio conclusions.
- First increment is a diagnostic logging slice, not a gameplay change.

## Next Action

Start Phase 11: phone-to-phone approach beacon/witness exchange. Keep the
current roster as local identity input only; radio freshness is the next proof
layer.

## Verification

2026-05-19:

- `:app:assembleDebug` completed successfully outside sandbox.
- Debug APK installed on physical device `R3CT20C8A8N`.
- Runtime permissions were granted with ADB.
- App launched on the physical phone.
- Diagnostic file was created on the phone under
  `/sdcard/Android/data/net.afterday.compas/files/diagnostics/`.
- Log was pulled to
  `artifacts/field-logs/diagnostics/field-radio-20260519-092839.log`.
- Log contains `FIELD_DIAG event=logger_start`, `WIFI_DIAG event=sensor_start`,
  `WIFI_DIAG event=request`, receiver results with `updated=true`, cached
  results with `updated=false`, and raw `WIFI_DIAG event=scan_entry` lines.

2026-05-19 Phase 2:

- `:app:assembleDebug` completed successfully outside sandbox.
- Phase 2 APK installed and launched on `R3CT20C8A8N`.
- Phase 2 APK installed and launched on `e089985a`.
- Both devices produced `FIELD_DIAG event=device_context`.
- Analyzer successfully parsed both context headers into
  `artifacts/field-analysis-phase2/device-context.csv`.

2026-05-19 Phase 3:

- Analyzer accepts named windows via `-Windows`.
- The 10:45 controlled run was regenerated with `cabinet`, `corridor`,
  `cabinet_return`, and `near_30cm` windows.
- Named report output:
  `artifacts/field-analysis-run-20260519-1045-named/summary.md`.

2026-05-19 Phase 4:

- Analyzer now exports zone fingerprints and bucket-level zone predictions.
- The 10:45 controlled run produced 29/32 correct bucket predictions (90.6%).
- Errors were concentrated on movement boundary buckets, which is expected for
  30-second buckets around manual transition times.

2026-05-19 Phase 5:

- Leave-one-bucket-out cross-validation added.
- Same-data evaluator accuracy remained 29/32 (90.6%).
- Cross-validated accuracy dropped to 11/32 (34.4%).
- This means the naive fingerprint score is useful for exploration but is not
  ready as runtime detection logic. Next model should focus on discriminative
  BSSID, transition smoothing, and device-specific stability.

2026-05-19 Phase 6:

- Diagnostic scan request interval changed to 1000 ms.
- App version changed to `1816-diagnostic-1s`.
- `WIFI_DIAG event=tick` added with `freshAgeMs` and cached result count.
- Analyzer now exports `freshness-timeline.csv` and `freshness-summary.csv`.
- Verification output:
  `artifacts/field-analysis-phase6-verify/freshness-summary.csv`.
- Short verification freshness:
  - `e089985a`: avg fresh age 918 ms, max fresh age 2231 ms, avg receiver gap
    2.41 s, max receiver gap 3.19 s.
  - `R3CT20C8A8N`: avg fresh age 1068 ms, max fresh age 2140 ms, avg receiver
    gap 2.17 s, max receiver gap 2.38 s.

2026-05-19 Phase 7:

- App version changed to `1816-diagnostic-sensors-1s`.
- Added diagnostic-only `FieldSensorDiagnosticSampler`.
- Field logs now include:
  - `SENSOR_DIAG event=tick` with accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetic field,
    yaw/pitch/roll, pressure, light, proximity, step counter, and location age.
  - `LOCATION_DIAG` provider status, last-known locations, and updates.
- Analyzer now exports `sensor-timeline.csv`, `sensor-summary.csv`,
  `location-timeline.csv`, and `location-summary.csv`.
- `:app:assembleDebug` completed successfully.
- Samsung verification log produced 34 sensor ticks, 8 registered sensors,
  9 location events, and intact Wi-Fi freshness output.
- OnePlus installed the APK but still needs manual unlock/permission handling
  for the new physical-activity permission before the next test.

2026-05-19 Phase 8:

- Office topology testing was stopped as the primary direction because it does
  not represent the forest distance/direction problem well enough.
- The current app logs already contain raw Wi-Fi scan entries, so no APK change
  was needed for the next step.
- Analyzer now supports controlled hotspot SSID filtering through
  `-BeaconSsids`.
- New outputs:
  - `beacon-timeline.csv`
  - `beacon-bucket-summary.csv`
  - `beacon-summary.csv`
- Verification script:
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\test-analyze-field-logs.ps1`.

2026-05-19 Phase 9:

- Obsidian corrected the MVP target: real MVP is IFF / `свой-чужой`, not
  object-beacon search.
- Added `IffActivity` as a separate tactical layer with tabs:
  `КОНТАКТ`, `КОМАНДА`, `КАРТА`.
- Added explicit `IFF` button on the main PDA screen.
- Added local `Я ПОДХОЖУ` prototype state.
- Build verification passed with `:app:assembleDebug`.
- Installed and checked on OnePlus `e089985a`:
  main PDA -> `IFF` -> `Я ПОДХОЖУ` -> `ВЫ ПОДХОДИТЕ`.
- Samsung `R3CT20C8A8N` was not visible over ADB during this install check.

2026-05-19 Phase 10:

- Added fixed local IFF roster:
  - `Вы`
  - `Петя`
  - `Вася`
  - `Женя`
- `КОМАНДА` renders the roster as selectable entries.
- Selecting a roster entry opens `КОНТАКТ` for that participant.
- `Я ПОДХОЖУ` remains scoped to local player `Вы`.
- Contact confidence is split into identity, proximity, position, and
  direction, with unimplemented proof layers shown as `UNKNOWN`.
- `:app:assembleDebug` completed successfully.
- Installed and checked on OnePlus `e089985a`:
  main PDA -> `IFF` -> `КОМАНДА` -> select `Петя` -> `КОНТАКТ` ->
  `Я ПОДХОЖУ`.
- Roster scrolling exposed `Женя`; Samsung is still not required for this
  slice.
